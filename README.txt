PHTML5 Photo Gallery by Rafael Amorim
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is a conversion of Multiverse by HTML5 UP(html5up.net) from a simple 
HMTL5 Photo Gallery page into a PHP configurable Photo Gallery. Also, I added 
multilanguage support, with an option to set a default language.

How to use
----------

1. Download the package and unzip it;
2. Put your images into images\full and images\thumbs and add filename, image 
   title, and description into list.php;
3. Change parameters like e-mail, social media address in config.php 
4. Finally, replace all texts your need into label.php 


Todo
----
- Generate thumbs automaticaly
- Add database suport

Say hello to Multiverse, a slick, one-page gallery design with a fully functional lightbox
(courtesy of my Poptrox plugin for jQuery) and a custom, reusable "panel" system (click the
"About" button in the lower right to see what I mean). Had a ton of fun putting this one
together, and I hope you have as much fun working with it :)
